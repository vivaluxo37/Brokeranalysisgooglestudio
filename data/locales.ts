Our platform highlights regulatory data and provides an AI Trust Score to help you assess broker safety."

It then compares your profile against our database of broker attributes—like costs, platforms, and regulation—to find the closest matches. It's a data-driven process designed to personalize your search."

Our Live Cost Analyzer provides real-time data on spreads and commissions for brokers you select, helping you identify the cheapest option at any given moment. Generally, ECN/STP brokers like Pepperstone or IC Markets offer very low raw spreads but charge a commission."

This is because both pairs have the USD as the quote currency and their base currencies (EUR and GBP) are geographically and economically linked." },
