Our platform highlights regulatory data and provides an AI Trust Score to help you assess broker safety."

It then compares your profile against our database of broker attributes—like costs, platforms, and regulation—to find the closest matches. It's a data-driven process designed to personalize your search."

Generally, ECN/STP brokers like Pepperstone or IC Markets offer very low raw spreads but charge a commission."

The bottom of the body is the open, and the top is the close." },
                q2: { question: "What is an 'uptrend' characterized by?", options: ["A series of lower highs and lower lows.", "A series of higher highs and higher lows.", "A sideways price movement.", "A single large price spike."], correctAnswer: "A series of higher highs and higher lows.", explanation: "An uptrend is identified by a consistent pattern of the price making new highs, followed by pullbacks that result in lows that are still higher than the previous lows." },
                q3: { question: "The 'wicks' or 'shadows' on a candlestick represent what?", options: ["The total trading volume for the period.", "The highest and lowest prices reached during the period.", "The commission paid for the trade.", "A prediction of future price movement."], correctAnswer: "The highest and lowest prices reached during the period.", explanation: "The 'body' of the candle shows the open and close prices, while the thin lines (wicks or shadows) extending from the body show the full price range—the highest and lowest points reached during that time period." },
                q4: { question: "A 'support' level on a chart is an area where...", options: ["Price has trouble breaking above and tends to fall.", "Price tends to stop falling and may reverse upwards.", "Trading volume is always highest.", "Leverage is automatically increased."], correctAnswer: "Price tends to stop falling and may reverse upwards.", explanation: "Support is a price level where buying interest is historically strong enough to overcome selling pressure, causing the price to bounce back up.
