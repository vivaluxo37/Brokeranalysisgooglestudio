## **Common Mistakes to Avoid** {#common-mistakes-to-avoid}

### **Overleveraging**

The most destructive mistake beginners make is using excessive leverage. While US regulations limit leverage to 50:1 for major pairs, professional traders typically use only 3:1 to 10:1 even with substantial experience.

### **Insufficient Education**

Rushing into live trading without proper education leads to preventable losses. Successful traders dedicate weeks or months to learning through quality educational materials before risking real capital.

### **Emotional Trading**

Allowing emotions to drive trading decisions results in poor outcomes. Developing and following a structured trading plan helps mitigate emotional responses and promotes disciplined trading behavior.
