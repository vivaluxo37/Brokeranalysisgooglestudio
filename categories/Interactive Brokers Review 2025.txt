Why choose Interactive Brokers
Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is highly recommended for those seeking a broker with all-round great services at low fees.

It has an unrivaled selection of all asset types from exchanges across the globe, and offers many trading platforms with great functionality and advanced research.

The IBKR Global Trader app is a great way, even for beginners, to start trading stocks, ETFs, options and cryptos. Meanwhile, more experienced users can enjoy the complex capabilities of Trader Workstation at the other end of the spectrum.

Among the broker's drawbacks, account opening is long and tedious, some platforms may be too complex for beginner traders, and customer service can be busy.

In all, IBKR tops our list of brokerages: it is the highest-rated broker at BrokerChooser.

Is Interactive Brokers regulated?
Yes, it is regulated by multiple top-tier financial authorities, like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI), the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

Interactive Brokers is also regulated by the Kanto Local Finance Bureau and is a member of Japan Securities Dealers Association and The Commodity Futures Association of Japan.

Is Interactive Brokers safe?
To be certain that a brokerage is safe, we highly advise that you check two facts:

how you are protected if something goes wrong, and
the background of the broker.
How you are protected
Interactive Brokers Group is an international broker, operating through multiple entities globally. This matters for you because the investor protection amount and the regulating authority differ from entity to entity.

Interactive Brokers in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom provide negative balance protection for its retail clients trading CFDs. Professional clients are not covered with this negative balance protection.

You can also hear directly from Interactive Brokers chairman and founder Thomas Peterffy about the safety of client funds held at brokers in general and at Interactive Brokers accounts in particular, by watching this CNBC interview (interview date: March 13, 2023).

*If you are a client of Interactive Brokers in the UK, the regulator and the protection amount also depends on the type of assets that you are trading:

If you trade CFDs, non-US stock index options and futures, you are protected by the FCA, up to the amount of £85,000.
If you trade stocks, bonds, funds and US stock index options, you are protected by the US investor protection (the protection amount is $500,000 with a cash limit of $250,000).
**In general, SIPC covers notes, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investment company shares, as well as other registered securities. It does not cover instruments such as unregistered investment contracts, unregistered limited partnerships, fixed annuity contracts, currency, and interests in gold, silver, or other commodity futures contracts or commodity options.

***If you are a client of Interactive Brokers Ireland Limited or Interactive Brokers Singapore Pte. Ltd., the protection amount also depends on the type of assets that you are trading:

If you trade stocks, bonds, funds and US stock index options, you are protected by the US investor protection (the protection amount is $500,000 with a cash limit of $250,000).
****For funds, clients have a protection of INR 2.5 million against the broker becoming deficient.

Our brokerage experts put together a comprehensive guide on the safety profile of Interactive Brokers.

Background
Interactive Brokers is based in the USA and was founded in 1977. During the last more four decades, IB managed to remain a leading force in the global brokerage market, despite multiple economic crises, which is a good sign for the broker's safety.

Interactive Brokers Group (the holding company of the different entities) is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange and is also part of the S&P 500 index. This inclusion underscores the company's scale and stability. Being publicly listed makes the broker more transparent, as it has to publish financial statements regularly.

The listing and the fact that it's regulated by both the UK's FCA and the US SEC are all great signs for Interactive Brokers's safety.

In negative news from the past few years, Interactive Brokers was fined $38 million by US regulators in August 2020 for not monitoring hundreds of millions of wire transfers that were potentially used for money laundering purposes. In addition, IB also failed to report some potential manipulations regarding microcap securities.

Why trust this information?
BrokerChooser is recognized across the industry as an authoritative voice on broker safety and investment fraud. For almost a decade, our seasoned legal and trading experts have been mapping the retail brokerage landscape and put together a comprehensive list identifying more than 40,000 brokers as potential scammers that we don't recommend.

Combining a mastery of online search data and an in-depth knowledge about trading scams, BrokerChooser released the study Unmasking evil - Data-Driven Insights into the Most Visited Investment Scams in Europe in 2024. This publication drew the appreciation of major European financial regulators for its detailed insights and actionable advice. The study was also co-signed and endorsed by some of the world's top online brokers.

In addition to top-shelf research, BrokerChooser has also turned its expertise into impactful practice. Our articles on potential scam brokers and our searchable scam broker database have drawn more than 5 million visitors from around the world, potentially saving that many investors from fraudulent providers.

Product selection
Score: 4.9/5
At Interactive Brokers, you have access to an extremely wide range of markets. Every type of asset is available.
Interactive Brokers has a great selection of products, with an exceptionally wide range of ETFs and bonds. IB also offers a couple of more exotic assets, such as warrants and structured products. It only lags behind its competitors in terms of FX pair and CFD selection. Availability of products depend on IB affiliate and country of residence.

IB provides access to more than 160 exchanges worldwide, including its alternative services, such as Interactive Advisors. This is an asset management service that is a mix of robo-advisory and social trading.

Interactive Brokers also offers an Overnight Trading Hours service that lists over 10,000 US stocks and ETFs, as well as the CBOE SPX Suite of Index Options. In addition, overnight trading is available to stock/ETF CFDs (where these products permitted). You can trade these US equities nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week.

This selection is great compared to competing brokers. Both Saxo and DEGIRO offer fewer option markets to trade on.

Interactive Brokers offers several tools to assist with options trading. While most of these tools are accessible through the TWS platform, some basic tools are also available via the Client Portal.

Master options trading with Options Wizard
One of the simplest tools, called the Options Wizard, can be found in the Client Portal by clicking 'Trade,' then 'Option Chains,' searching for and selecting the underlying symbol, and finally clicking 'Options Wizard.'

The Options Wizard helps you choose an options trading strategy based on your expectations for the price or volatility of the underlying asset.

For example, if you anticipate that stock X's price will rise within a specific time frame, you can input these details into the Options Wizard, and Interactive Brokers will provide you with options trading strategies that align with your view.



Futures
Interactive Brokers offers an extensive selection of futures products and markets. There are 30 markets available, which is more than what competitors offer. Similarly to options, you will find both major and minor markets.

Interest on cash balances
Interactive Brokers offers attractive interest rates on the uninvested cash balances of clients. As an example, the rate is 3.8% for USD for international IBKR Pro clients. However, strict requirements and conditions apply.

Exact rates differ by the country of the client, currency and by the total value of a client's assets, as well as whether the client has an IBKR Lite or IBKR Pro account. To be eligible, accounts must have more than $10,000 (or equivalent) cash in the account.

No interest is paid on the first $10,000. Above that, interest is paid proportionally: to get the maximum interest, you need an account value of $100,000 (or equivalent).

In addition, your idle cash must be held in the securities segment of your account. Cash held in the commodities segment does not earn any interest.

See the table below for interest rates for selected currencies, or check out IB's interest rates page for the latest rates and more details.

OG of Online Brokerage Business
“Interactive Brokers has an extended legacy of offering its customers access to global markets, with fees that are among the lowest in the industry. You can trade equities, options, fixed income products, and futures around the world and around the clock, on your desktop or on a mobile device. IBKR is well-suited to sophisticated traders who want to take advantage of the low fees for transactions and for margin loans, and has taken strides towards serving less experienced traders over the last five years. The firm’s order routing engine squeezes every pip out of executing an order. I would still advise new traders to gain experience at a more user-friendly broker before taking the leap to IBKR’s services; however, they could give IBKR’s Global Trader app a try.”
