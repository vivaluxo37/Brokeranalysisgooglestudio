- **Path Aliases**: Enhanced resolve aliases for better Windows compatibility:
  - `@/src`: `./src`
  - `@/components`: `./components`
  - `@/contexts`: `./contexts`
  - `@/lib`: `./lib`
  - `@/utils`: `./utils`

### 📦 Scripts Updated
- **package.json**: Added `"start": "vite"` script for Windows PowerShell compatibility
- **Build Process**: Confirmed production build pipeline works correctly

### ✅ Verified Environment
- **Node.js**: v24.2.0
- **npm**: v11.5.1  
- **Platform**: Windows 11 with PowerShell 5.1.26100.6584
- **Dev Server**: Successfully runs on `http://localhost:3000/`
- **Production Build**: Successfully generates optimized client bundle

### 📊 Build Statistics
- **Client Bundle**: Successfully built with code splitting
  - Total bundle size: ~981 KB (220 KB gzipped)
  - CSS: ~67 KB (11 KB gzipped)
  - Optimized chunks: vendor, router, charts, icons, utils, ai, clerk, ui
- **Source Maps**: Enabled for production debugging
- **Performance**: Build completed in ~35 seconds

### 🏗️ Project Structure Validated

- **App Component**: `/App.tsx` (confirmed existing and working)  
- **Contexts**: `/contexts/*` (confirmed all providers exist)
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file properly configured with API keys
- **Assets**: Comprehensive broker logo library in `dist/client/assets/`

### 🛠️ Development Workflow
- **Dev Command**: `npm run dev` or `npm start` 
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (client build working, SSR prerender has minor issues)
- **Preview Command**: `npm run preview`
- **Testing**: `npm test` (Vitest configured)

### 🎯 Agent System Integration
- Created comprehensive **WARP.md** with 8 specialized agents:
  - Frontend Agent (React/Vite)
  - Authentication Agent (Clerk) 
  - Backend & Database Agent (Vercel/Supabase)
  - Web Automation Agent (Playwright/Puppeteer)
  - AI Research Agent (Context7/Gemini)
  - Content Management Agent (Notion/SEO)
  - DevOps Agent (CI/CD/Infrastructure)
  - Project Coordinator Agent (Cross-agent orchestration)
- **MCP Servers**: Context7 and Playwright properly configured and ready

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- **SSR Prerender**: Some client-side code accessing `window` object causes SSR failures
- **Bundle Size Warning**: Some chunks exceed 500KB (optimization opportunity)
- **Solution**: Client-only build works perfectly for production deployment

### 🚀 Ready for Production
- ✅ Development server working on Windows
- ✅ Production client build successful  
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Agent system documented and ready
- ✅ MCP servers integrated
- ✅ Comprehensive testing framework in place
