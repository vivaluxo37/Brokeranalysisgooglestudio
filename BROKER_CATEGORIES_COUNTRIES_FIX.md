# Broker Categories and Countries Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis
Current issues identified:
1. **Categories showing all 78 brokers** instead of filtering by actual features
2. **Country pages include brokers not licensed for those countries**
3. **Need proper filtering based on actual broker capabilities**

## Required Fixes

### 1. Category Filters - Current Issues & Solutions

#### ECN Brokers
**Current Problem**: Shows all 78 brokers  
**Expected**: Only true ECN/STP brokers  
**Solution**: Filter by `coreInfo.brokerType` === 'ECN' OR accountTypes with ECN

#### MT4 Brokers  
**Current Problem**: Shows all 78 brokers  
**Expected**: Only brokers offering MetaTrader 4  
**Solution**: Filter by `technology.platforms` containing 'MT4' or 'MetaTrader 4'

#### Beginners
**Current Problem**: Filter too loose (score > 8.0)  
**Expected**: Low deposit, good education, beginner-friendly  
**Solution**: Filter by `accessibility.minDeposit` <= 100 AND score >= 8.5

#### Scalping Brokers
**Current Problem**: Filter not precise enough  
**Expected**: Low spreads + ECN + allows scalping  
**Solution**: Filter by `tradingConditionsExtended.scalpingAllowed: true` AND `coreInfo.brokerType` === 'ECN'

#### Copy Trading
**Current Problem**: Some brokers marked but not verified  
**Expected**: Brokers with actual copy trading platforms  
**Solution**: Filter by `platformFeatures.copyTrading.available: true`

#### Islamic Brokers
**Current Problem**: Some marked but not verified  
**Expected**: Actual swap-free accounts available  
**Solution**: Filter by `accountManagement.islamicAccount.available: true`

#### High Leverage
**Current Problem**: Shows all brokers  
**Expected**: Brokers offering 1:500+ leverage  
**Solution**: Filter by `tradingConditions.maxLeverage` parsed to number >= 500

#### Stock Trading
**Current Problem**: Shows all brokers  
**Expected**: Brokers with 100+ stock CFDs  
**Solution**: Filter by `tradableInstruments.stocks.total` >= 100

### 3. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Fix Category Filters

2. Test each category to ensure proper filtering
3. Verify each category has 5-15 relevant brokers

#### Phase 2: Rebuild Country Mappings
1. Create new country broker mappings based on actual licensing
2. Include only brokers legally allowed in each country
3. Consider local deposit/withdrawal methods
4. Ensure compliance with local regulations

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. Test all 16 categories
2. Test all 43 country pages  
3. Verify broker detail pages accessible
4. Ensure logo display works correctly

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Fix First)
1. ECN Brokers - core trading feature
2. MT4 Brokers - most popular platform
3. United States - strict regulatory requirements
4. United Kingdom - major market

### Medium Priority
5. Islamic Brokers - religious compliance
6. Scalping Brokers - trading strategy
7. Copy Trading - popular feature
8. Major EU countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain)

### Lower Priority
9. High Leverage - feature-based category
10. Stock Trading - feature-based category
11. Smaller countries (Kenya, Philippines, Malaysia)
12. Emerging markets (India, China)

## Expected Results
