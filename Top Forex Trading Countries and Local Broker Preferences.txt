Top Forex Trading Countries and Local Broker Preferences
Forex trading is global, but certain countries dominate the market.  A VT Markets analysis reports that the United Kingdom (≈341,000 traders), United States (335,000), Japan (223,000), Singapore (218,000), Hong Kong (200,000), Australia (195,000), Switzerland (182,000), France (120,000), Germany (109,000) and China (105,000) are the ten countries with the largest number of forex traders.  We also consider other high-interest markets such as India, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa and Kenya.  Below, we discuss each country’s traders and list at least five brokers popular with local traders, highlighting local deposit/withdrawal options and other features (regulation, language support, spreads, etc.) that make them attractive.
United Kingdom
The UK leads in active forex traders, driven by its mature market and FCA regulation.  British traders typically demand FCA-licensed brokers with strong consumer protections (FSCS fund insurance, low spreads, GBP-denominated accounts, etc.).  For example, FCA-authorized Pepperstone and eToro are consistently highly rated by UK users.  Other popular choices include UK-based IG and CMC Markets (both FCA-regulated), which offer local support and competitive pricing, and Tickmill, a global broker with FCA regulation.  These brokers allow deposits in GBP via local bank transfer or card and support UK payment methods (e.g. Faster Payments, PayPal/Skrill, debit cards), making funding and withdrawals seamless for UK clients.
Pepperstone – An FCA-regulated Australian broker with an office in London.  Offers ultra-low spreads (from 0.0 pips on Razor accounts) and supports GBP account funding via UK bank transfer or credit/debit cards.  Pepperstone is highly rated by UK traders and segregates UK client funds under FCA rules.
eToro – A popular social-copy trading broker (FCA-regulated) that supports GBP deposits.  Its UK platform (web and mobile) includes copy trading features and access to stocks/crypto, with zero commissions on forex.  (eToro is top-rated by UK users.)
IG – A historic UK broker (FCA-regulated) headquartered in London.  IG offers its proprietary platform plus MT4, tier-1 liquidity, and GBP base accounts.  It provides FSCS protection and a wide currency pair selection, appealing to UK professionals and beginners.
CMC Markets – UK (AMF/BaFin/FCA) broker with an FCA-regulated unit in London.  Offers sophisticated charting, guaranteed stop orders (negative balance protection), and a “limited-risk” account option tailored to local regulations.  Accepts GBP deposits via local methods.
Swissquote – A Swiss broker (FINMA-regulated) with a London branch.  It offers EUR and GBP trading accounts and supports UK funding methods.  Traders like that it’s publicly listed and segregates funds with UK banks.

United States
The US has hundreds of thousands of forex traders, all requiring strict CFTC/NFA regulation.  Top US-acceptable brokers include IG US (IG Group’s US arm), OANDA USA, and FOREX.com (Gain Capital) – each holding CFTC/NFA licenses.  These brokers offer USD accounts and allow deposits via US-based methods (ACH and wire transfers, bank checks or debit cards).  US traders also value robust trading platforms (MT4/MT5 and proprietary), educational resources, and strict compliance.  For example:
IG US – Regulated by the CFTC/NFA and New York State. Offers the award-winning IG Trading platform and MT4.  It provides USD accounts and accepts ACH and wire funding.  Its high regulation and long track record make it a trusted choice for US residents.
OANDA USA – CFTC/NFA-regulated, offers MT4 and its fxTrade platform.  USD base accounts, tight spreads, and fund transfers via ACH or wire.  Known for strong customer support and extensive market research for US clients.
FOREX.com – The US arm of GAIN Capital, fully CFTC-licensed.  Accepts USD deposits by ACH/wire and offers both MT4 and its own Web Trader/Advanced Trader platforms.  It caters to all levels of US traders with competitive pricing.
Interactive Brokers (IBKR) – A major US broker (SEC-regulated) known for multi-asset trading.  While IBKR no longer offers leveraged FX CFDs in the US, Indian/NRI residents use it for currency ETFs.  In general, IBKR provides USD trading accounts and ACH/bank deposit for US clients.
CME/ICE Exchange Platform – Many US retail traders access currency futures via the CME (Globex) through futures brokers (e.g. TD Ameritrade – no longer offering, Tastytrade, or similar).  These exchanges allow trading USD currency futures under CFTC oversight.

(Note: All US forex brokers must abide by strict leverage caps (max 50:1 on major pairs) and publish NFA-required risk disclosures.  Local deposit methods (ACH and wires) and USD liquidity are key factors in broker choice.)
Japan
Japan’s forex traders (≈223,000) operate under tight FSA supervision.  Local traders prefer brokers authorized by the Japanese FSA (e.g. IG Japan, OANDA Japan, Mitsui-SBI FX), which allow JPY-denominated accounts and obey local rules.  Offshore brokers are popular too, provided they support JPY funding.  For instance, Pepperstone, Fusion Markets, XM and IC Markets all offer JPY-based accounts, letting Japanese clients deposit and trade in yen (avoiding conversion fees).  These brokers permit funding via local Japanese banks (instant NekoPay/FastPay transfers) or international cards, and they provide Japanese-language support.  Key factors for Japanese traders include low spreads on yen pairs, negative balance protection, and well-known platforms (MT4/MT5 or cTrader).
IG (Japan) – Japanese subsidiary of IG Group, FSA-registered.  Offers MT4/ProRealTime, JPY accounts and supports local bank transfers in yen.  IG’s strong local compliance and education resources appeal to conservative Japanese traders.
OANDA (Japan) – FSA-licensed and headquartered in Tokyo.  Provides a popular MT4 platform and proprietary fxTrade, plus JPY accounts.  Deposits via Japanese domestic transfer (e.g. Zengin) are supported, along with international cards.
XM – An international broker that actively markets in Japan.  Although licensed offshore (CySEC/ASIC), XM offers JPY base accounts and allows Japanese-language support.  Funding can be done via credit card or local wire (though processed as USD or EUR).
Pepperstone – ASIC-regulated global broker accepted in Japan.  It supports JPY account currency and offers MT4/MT5/cTrader.  Japanese traders use bank transfers or global e-wallets to fund Pepperstone accounts, and benefit from its low spreads and STP execution.
Fusion Markets – An Australian broker that provides JPY accounts.  It accepts deposits via international transfer or e-payments.  Fusion is noted for very low commissions and supports cTrader/MT4/5.

Singapore
Singapore (≈218,000 traders) is regulated by MAS, so brokers must comply with strict local oversight.  Traders here look for MAS-regulated or globally reputable platforms.  Top picks include MAS-licensed IG Asia (IG Group) and **Saxo Markets (Singapore)**, both offering SGD accounts and support for SGD deposits via local banks or PayNow.  CMC Markets Singapore (MAS-registered) is also popular, thanks to its powerful Next Generation platform and risk-control features.  Other favored brokers are offshore but strong in Singapore, such as OANDA, FXCM, and FOREX.com Singapore, which support multi-currency accounts and local payment methods.  Singaporeans value robust trading apps, as well as local customer service and market research.
IG Asia (Singapore) – MAS-regulated arm of IG Group.  Provides SGD accounts, local deposit/withdraw via DBS FAST and PayNow, and both proprietary and MT4 platforms.  It offers guaranteed stops and advanced charting, complying with MAS rules on client protection.

Hong Kong
Hong Kong (≈200,000 traders) is regulated by the SFC, but locals often use both Hong Kong and offshore brokers.  Popular brokers include IG International (HK) and IG Asia (SFC-licensed), which allow HKD accounts.  Notably, IG supports base accounts in HKD and provides a fully Chinese-language platform, catering to local clients.  Other widely used brokers are FP Markets, IC Markets and FxPro (global ASIC-regulated firms with HK operations) and OANDA HK.  These brokers typically offer HKD trading accounts and support local deposit methods (e.g. HSBC/Bank of China transfers, FPS/PayMe, or China UnionPay cards).  They emphasize multilingual service (English/Mandarin/Cantonese), as well as low spreads and immediate electronic funding.
IG (HK) – The Hong Kong arm of IG Group, SFC-regulated.  Offers a Chinese-language platform and allows trading accounts in HKD.  Local HK bank transfers (FPS) and credit card funding in HKD are supported, avoiding conversion costs.  IG’s safe, fully-regulated setup is a key attraction.

Australia
Australia (≈195,000 traders) has a deep forex market under ASIC regulation.  Locals prefer ASIC-regulated brokers with AUD deposit options and tight spreads.  Pepperstone (ASIC/FCA-regulated) is a top choice – it provides AUD base accounts, accepts PayID/Osko/AU bank transfers and offers MT4/5/cTrader with razor-thin pricing.  Other favorites include IC Markets, FP Markets, CMC Markets Australia, and IG Australia – all ASIC-licensed.  These brokers offer AUD trading accounts and support BPAY or instant bank transfers.  They also emphasize speed and technology (news feeds, advanced charting) and often offer copy-trading or social features.  For example:
Pepperstone – ASIC-regulated (Melbourne) ECN broker.  Offers a dedicated Australian platform (MT4/5, cTrader) and allows AUD deposits via Osko/Plaid or PayID (via major banks), with 0% deposit fees.  Known for ultra-low spreads (from 0.0 pips) on major pairs.

IG Australia – Regulated by ASIC and FCA, IG provides AUD accounts and local funding via Australian banks.  Its proprietary platform and MT4 are available.  IG’s global resources and low fees on currency ETFs/currencies make it a solid option down under.

Switzerland
Switzerland (≈182,000 traders) has a unique environment.  Many Swiss traders use reputable offshore brokers, but local FINMA-regulated brokers like Swissquote and Dukascopy are also key players.  Global ASIC/FCA brokers are widely used: for example, FP Markets and Fusion Markets (Australia), as well as BlackBull Markets and Global Prime (New Zealand), all accept Swiss clients.  These brokers often allow CHF base accounts (or multi-currency accounts including CHF) so Swiss users can deposit in CHF.  They emphasize top-tier security and low spreads.  For example:
FP Markets – ASIC-regulated Australian broker.  Offers CHF accounts (Swiss clients can fund in CHF via wire or e-wallet).  Noted for very tight spreads on majors and free withdrawals by bank transfer.  It has multilingual support (including German).
Fusion Markets – ASIC-regulated global broker (NZ-based entity).  Provides multi-currency accounts (CHF funding supported) and accepts e-wallet deposits (Skrill/Neteller) and crypto.  Fusion is known for ultra-low commissions and a powerful cTrader platform.

France
France (≈120,000 traders) requires AMF or EU passported brokers.  Many French traders use EU-regulated brokers (CySEC/ASIC/FCA) that comply with MiFID.  For example, MultiBank Group serves French clients under a CySEC license.  CMC Markets (France) holds an AMF license and even offers a special “limited-risk” account under French Sapin II law.  Other well-known brokers include Saxo Bank and Interactive Brokers (both EU-regulated) and Pepperstone.  French traders typically require EUR-denominated accounts and deposit via SEPA bank transfers or French credit cards.  Key local factors: guaranteed stop-loss rules and negative-balance protection per EU rules.  For example:
MultiBank (Europe) – Operates under CySEC but services France.  All FX/CFD trading follows EU/MiFID rules (e.g. leverage caps).  French clients can open accounts in EUR and fund via SEPA transfers.  MultiBank is noted for its advanced platforms and adherence to local regulations.
CMC Markets France – Part of CMC UK but AMF-licensed for France.  Meets all French regulatory requirements (negative-balance protection, guaranteed stops).  Accepts EUR funding by SEPA and offers an intuitive web/mobile platform.  CMC also provides French-language support and educational content.
Saxo Bank – Danish broker with EU-wide operation (and an EU passport for France).  Saxo offers EUR accounts and supports payments by SEPA or local card.  Its SaxoTraderGO platform is feature-rich, and it abides by ESMA/AMF rules on risk limits.

Pepperstone – ASIC/FCA broker popular in France.  Offers EUR accounts (via its European entity) and accepts EU wire transfers.  French traders appreciate Pepperstone’s low spreads and support for MT4/5, as well as French customer service via its European office.

Germany
Germany (≈109,000 traders) is a disciplined market under BaFin regulation.  German traders favor brokers that meet MiFID II standards.  Many use global FCA/ASIC brokers as well as domestic-approved firms.  For example, Fusion Markets and Global Prime (both ASIC-regulated) are frequently mentioned by German users, as are Axi (Axitrader) and Swissquote.  These brokers all accept EUR deposits (often with SEPA or local wire) and offer robust trading platforms.  German traders pay attention to negative-balance protection and EU-level leverage caps (max 30:1 on majors).  Some local features: taxable account statements and built-in risk tools (German “guaranteed stop”).  Key options:
Fusion Markets – Australian broker popular in Europe.  Allows EUR-denominated accounts with SEPA funding.  Known for very low spreads (from ~0.01 EUR on EUR/USD) and copy-trading features.
Global Prime – ASIC-regulated (NZ) broker.  Offers EUR accounts and accepts SEPA/wire deposits.  It provides ECN pricing with low commission.  Its MetaTrader platform and overall low fees attract German users.
Axi (Axitrader) – ASIC/FCA-regulated.  Allows EUR accounts and SEPA transfers.  It offers both “Pro” zero-commission accounts and standard accounts, and provides multilingual support (including German).  Axi is known for instant account opening and useful mobile apps.
Swissquote – FINMA-regulated Swiss broker (accessible in Germany under EU passport).  Offers trading in EUR and other currencies with tight spreads.  Swissquote’s public trust and strong tech make it a solid, if premium-priced, choice for German investors.
eToro – Global broker with an EU license.  German traders use eToro mainly for copy/social trading.  It supports EUR deposits via SEPA bank transfer or local debit cards.  eToro’s negative-balance protection and wide instrument range (including stocks) are attractive to German clients.

China
China (≈105,000 traders) is heavily regulated by SAFE/PBOC.  Chinese residents typically use domestic currency pairs via local exchanges, but for online trading many use international brokers through local “introducer” firms.  Top international brokers servicing China include Fusion Markets and Global Prime (both ASIC-regulated), Hantec Markets (FCA-regulated with Hong Kong office), IC Markets, and Pepperstone.  These brokers often offer currency accounts denominated in major currencies (USD, HKD) since RMB on-ramps are limited.  Critically, many Chinese traders fund accounts via China UnionPay or Alipay to avoid conversion fees.  Local deposit and withdrawal options are key: brokers serving China often enable UnionPay card payments or QR-code Alipay transactions in RMB.  Other important factors: strong execution and low forex spreads (margin trading is banned, so only non-leveraged trading is allowed by law).
Fusion Markets – Ranked #1 for China by BrokerChooser.  ASIC-regulated, it allows Chinese traders to fund via UnionPay (processed as USD) and offers very low commissions.  Fusion supports multiple platforms and is praised for fast, digital onboarding.
Global Prime – ASIC-regulated broker also favored by Chinese clients.  It offers robust risk controls and accepts UnionPay deposits.  Traders appreciate its no-withdrawal-fee policy and tight spreads.
Hantec Markets – FCA-regulated (UK) broker with a Hong Kong subsidiary.  It offers broad CFD/forex markets and allows RMB deposits via local Chinese banks (no currency conversion fee).  Hantec emphasizes local language support and no fees on deposits/withdrawals.
IC Markets – Popular Australian broker.  Chinese clients use IC Markets for its low spreads and wide range of pairs.  Funds can be deposited by UnionPay or Alipay (processed via USD) without conversion fees.  The broker provides Chinese-language support and MT4/5 platforms.
Pepperstone – ASIC/FCA-regulated ECN broker.  Chinese traders use Pepperstone’s platforms (cTrader/MT4) and take advantage of RMB-friendly payments (UnionPay/Alipay are supported for quick deposits).  Pepperstone is valued for its client fund security and global reputation.

India
India’s retail forex trading is restricted, but Indians still participate via permitted currency futures or overseas accounts.  Forex brokers for Indian clients must avoid INR trading except through NSE currency futures.  Popular brokers among Indians include Interactive Brokers (SEBI-registered for forex brokerage, mainly for futures), IG, FOREX.com, XM, Pepperstone and others that accept Indian residents.  For example, a ForexBrokers guide lists Interactive Brokers (IBKR) as the top regulated choice for India and IG as the best overall (though not RBI-regulated for forex).  Many global brokers (Fusion Markets, FP Markets, Eightcap, BlackBull, Global Prime, Axi, etc.) are also used by Indian traders.  Since local law forbids INR-funded foreign trading, these brokers typically fund accounts in USD or EUR.  Indian payment methods are limited: traders generally deposit by international wire transfers, credit/debit cards (USD/EUR), or e-wallets (Skrill/Neteller).  For example, Fusion Markets’ India section notes funding via Visa/Mastercard and e-pay services.  Key concerns for Indians include RBI compliance (e.g. no leverage over 50:1 on currency futures), and access to INR pairs only on domestic exchanges.
Interactive Brokers (IBKR) – A US broker that is also a member of India’s stock exchanges and SEBI-regulated for currency futures.  It offers INR-denominated margin trading of NSE currency pairs.  Deposits can be made via Indian bank transfer (INR) or international wire for global currencies.  IBKR’s advanced TWS platform and strong regulation make it highly trusted in India.
IG – Although not SEBI-regulated for forex in India, IG (FCA-regulated) is popular for its broad offerings.  Indian traders use IG’s platform for global currencies and CFDs, funding via INR INR-currency futures or USD/EUR bank wires.  IG India’s strong local support and educational materials attract users (IG was rated India’s top broker).
FOREX.com (GAIN Capital) – A major global broker (registered with SEBI for futures).  Accepts Indian clients and offers INR currency futures on NSE as well as major forex CFDs offshore.  Indian traders can fund FOREX.com via international wire transfers or IB’s INR channels.
Fusion Markets – ASIC-regulated global broker.  It accepts Indian residents and allows deposits via Visa/Mastercard or e-wallets.  Fusion has very low commissions (0 on classic account) and is noted for a frictionless signup.
FP Markets – ASIC-regulated (listed on ASX).  It provides Indian traders with MT4/5 trading and accepts international wire/card in USD or AUD.  FP Markets is known for its competitive spreads and many trading tools.
Eightcap and BlackBull Markets are also frequently mentioned brokers for Indian clients (both ASIC-regulated with low fees), as are Axi, Global Prime, and easyMarkets.  All these brokers accept Indian residents, though deposit in INR is not supported (clients deposit in major currencies via global payment rails).

(Note: Indians can trade forex only on NSE’s USD/INR, EUR/INR, GBP/INR futures or through approved brokers. All above brokers operate legally from outside India, adhering to India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme when funding.)
Philippines
The Philippines has a growing retail forex community.  Local traders favor brokers that provide Filipino peso (PHP) accounts or local e-payments.  A broker guide for the Philippines notes five top picks: XM, Pepperstone, FBS, AvaTrade and FP Markets, among others.  Crucially, several brokers explicitly offer GCash and bank transfers for PH clients.  For example, FBS advertises GCash, BPI and UnionBank deposit/withdrawal options with no fees.  Local traders also look for brokers with Filipino-language support and local customer service.  Other factors: low minimum deposits (often just $5), and choice of platforms (MT4/5, cTrader) that work well on mobile.
FBS – An international broker with a strong Philippine focus.  FBS allows PHP deposits via GCash (mobile wallet) as well as Philippine banks (BPI, UnionBank).  It offers very small minimum deposits ($1–$5) and fixed/cent accounts that appeal to Filipino beginners.  FBS is known for frequent local promotions and FB support in Tagalog/English.
XM – A global broker (CySEC/ASIC-regulated) popular in the PH.  While it doesn’t list GCash specifically, XM accepts local currency transfers via banks or DragonPay (a local payment gateway).  It offers PHP-denominated accounts, low spreads, and multilingual support, making it convenient for Filipino traders.
Pepperstone – ASIC/FCA-regulated broker that accepts PH clients.  It provides multi-currency accounts (USD/EUR/AUD base) and deposits via international card or wire.  Pepperstone has a Manila-based office and supports local bank transfers through partner banks.  It’s favored for its tight spreads and MT4/5/cTrader platforms.
AvaTrade – The Irish broker, operating via a Philippine subsidiary (AvaTrade South), is licensed by the BSP.  It offers a Philippine peso account option and local funding (through UnionBank/DragonPay) for Filipino clients.  AvaTrade’s proprietary WebTrader and MT4 platforms, plus its regulatory compliance (BSP-license), give locals confidence.
FP Markets – ASIC-regulated (global) broker with a growing PH presence.  Accepts local clients with accounts in USD/AUD and allows deposit via popular local channels (GCash through a payment processor).  It offers ECN pricing (spreads from 0.0 pips) and funds trading education in the Philippines.

Malaysia
Malaysia’s forex market is served by both local and offshore brokers.  Malaysian traders want ringgit (MYR) funding options and local payment methods.  Many brokers now support Malaysia-specific channels.  For example, Fusion Markets explicitly allows DuitNow and FPX transfers in MYR.  Other brokers popular in Malaysia include IC Markets, FP Markets, BlackBull Markets, AvaTrade and FBS.  Key features for Malaysians: support for MYR accounts, e-wallets like AstroPay, DuitNow or DuitNow QR, and Malay/English support.  Trust is also important, so many choose brokers with global regulation (ASIC, FCA) and local service.
Fusion Markets – An ASIC-regulated Australian broker.  It supports MYR deposits via DuitNow and FPX (Malaysia’s instant bank transfer systems).  Malaysians can open CAD/USD/AUD accounts; Fusion converts MYR to USD automatically at no extra fee.  Traders like Fusion for its low commissions and MirrorTrader copy-trading options.
IC Markets – ASIC-regulated broker, popular in Malaysia.  Allows deposit by local bank transfer (may use FPX via intermediaries) and e-wallets.  IC offers ECN pricing and is known for rapid execution, which appeals to Malaysian scalpers and automated traders.
FP Markets – Australian broker (ASIC-regulated).  Accepts Malaysian clients and provides funding via FPX and DuitNow (through partner services).  Offers MT4/5 and cTrader, with very competitive spreads on MYR-based pairs.  FP Markets has 24/7 support and often holds Malaysia-focused trading seminars.
BlackBull Markets – NZ-regulated broker favored in Asia.  It supports deposits via local Asian methods (AstroPay, FPX, etc.) and offers MYR-USD forex with low commission.  Malaysian traders like BlackBull’s multilingual support and MT4/5 availability.
AvaTrade – BSP-regulated Philippine broker also popular in Malaysia.  It allows MYR bank transfers via DuitNow or FPX (through outsourced gateway).  AvaTrade is known for its copy-trading (Zulutrade integration) and extensive education, which appeals to Malaysian beginners.

South Africa
South Africa’s retail forex market has grown under the FSCA (formerly FSB).  South African traders often use FSCA-licensed foreign brokers with ZAR accounts.  Top choices include IG South Africa (FSCA-regulated affiliate of IG Group) and AvaTrade South Africa (FSCA-regulated BSP license), as well as global brokers like Plus500, XM, and FP Markets that service ZA clients.  A key local advantage is the ability to deposit/withdraw in ZAR, avoiding conversion fees.  For instance, many brokers allow ZAR bank transfers or even e-wallets (SnapScan, etc.).  Traders also value low-cost trading on USD/ZAR and EUR/ZAR, local-language support (English/Afrikaans), and compliance with FSCA rules.
IG South Africa – IG’s FSCA-regulated entity.  Offers accounts in ZAR, facilitating local deposits via EFT.  It provides the same IG trading platforms (web/desktop/mobile) and adherence to global standards (negative balance protection).  IG is rated the top broker in SA.
AvaTrade South Africa – FSCA-regulated local subsidiary.  Accepts ZAR funding through local bank or electronic payments.  The proprietary AvaTradeGO mobile app (and MT4/5) supports local and international assets.  AvaTrade’s strong educational content and social trading (DupliTrade) are popular among new ZA traders.
Plus500 – UK/FCA-regulated but operates under FSCA (it’s authorized to advertise in SA).  Offers CFDs in ZAR and accepts local ZAR deposits (via Ozow or standard EFT).  Known for its easy-to-use platform (web/mobile) and commission-free model.
XM – FSCA-registered (through its EU arm).  Allows South African clients to fund in ZAR via domestic transfers or Instapay.  XM is noted for ultra-low spreads and a large variety of instruments, which appeal to experienced ZA traders.
FP Markets – ASIC-regulated broker also popular in SA.  South African traders can deposit in ZAR or USD (via local transfer or credit card).  FP offers MT4/5, competitive pricing, and local support.

Kenya (and Similar African Markets)
Kenya has emerged as a high-interest forex market (Kenyan traders rank among the most engaged globally).  The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) regulates local participants, so brokers with CMA licensing are favored.  Pepperstone and HF Markets (HotForex/HFM) both hold Kenyan licenses and support M-Pesa deposits, which is crucial for Kenyan users.  Other brokers popular in Kenya include Exness, XM, and HotForex, many of which also offer M-Pesa or local EFT funding.  Key preferences for Kenyan traders are: support for KES funding (via M-Pesa or EFT), mobile-friendly platforms, and local customer service.  For example:
Pepperstone – Australian broker (ASIC/FCA) that is CMA-approved in Kenya.  It explicitly accepts M-Pesa deposits and withdrawals instantly and free of charge.  This means Kenyan traders can fund in KES via the mobile wallet.  Pepperstone offers MT4/5, razor-thin spreads, and a variety of educational resources, making it very attractive in Kenya.
HFM (HF Markets) – International broker with a CMA license (Kenyan subsidiary).  It supports local deposit/withdrawal via M-Pesa and bank transfer in KES.  HFM offers ECN accounts (zero spread), MT4/5 platforms, and strong CMA-regulated protection.  Its localized presence (customer support in Swahili/English) builds trust.
Exness – FCA-regulated broker that also holds a Kenyan license.  Exness permits KES funding via M-Pesa and local banks.  Traders like its low minimum deposit (as little as $1) and high leverage, along with a variety of account types.
XM – ASIC/CySEC broker that accepts Kenyan clients and provides MetaTrader platforms.  Funding can be done via M-Pesa or local EFT through intermediaries.  XM’s educational webinars and Indonesian/English support make it popular in East Africa.
HotForex – FCA/CySEC-regulated broker (brand of HF Markets).  It has a Kenyan office and CMA license.  HotForex offers local KES funding (through M-Pesa) and a wide range of Forex/CFD products.  Its strong customer service in Nairobi and no-deposit fees are advantages.
