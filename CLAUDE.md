# CLAUDE.md - Development Guidelines & Best Practices

**IMPORTANT**: This file contains authoritative guidelines that govern all coding, reasoning, and project management behaviors. These rules are persistent and override conversational prompts unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## üß† Agent Optimization & Reasoning

### Extended Reasoning Protocol
- **Complex Tasks**: Always engage in deep, multi-step reasoning before implementation
- **Subagent Decomposition**: For intricate projects, automatically split into specialized roles:
  - **Planner**: Creates architecture and task breakdown
  - **Coder**: Implements based on specifications
  - **Reviewer**: Validates code quality and best practices
  - **Tester**: Ensures functionality and edge cases
- **Multi-shot Prompting**: Use consistent examples and structured formats for predictable outputs
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain key facts and project state across interactions

### Decision Making Framework
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand constraints, stakeholders, and success criteria
2. **Generate Options**: Consider multiple implementation approaches
3. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Assess complexity, maintainability, performance, security
4. **Select Approach**: Choose optimal solution based on project needs
5. **Document Rationale**: Explain why specific approach was chosen

## üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow

### Planning First Protocol
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Complex?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Generate Written Plan]
    B -->|No| D[Direct Implementation]
    C --> E[User Approval]
    E --> F[Implementation]
    D --> F
    F --> G[Testing & Review]
    G --> H[Deployment]
```

- **Mandatory Planning**: For all non-trivial tasks, create structured plan before coding
- **Plan Components**:
  - Overview and objectives
  - Technical approach and architecture
  - Implementation steps with dependencies
  - Testing strategy
  - Risk assessment and mitigation
  - Timeline and deliverables

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Test Creation**: Write tests based on input/output specifications
2. **Test Execution**: Run tests to confirm they fail initially
3. **Commit Tests**: Separate commit for failing tests
4. **Implementation**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
5. **Code Refactoring**: Improve design while maintaining test coverage
6. **Commit Implementation**: Separate commit for working code
7. **Repeat**: Continue cycle for all features

### Iterative Refinement Process
- **Small Increments**: Break large features into manageable pieces
- **Continuous Integration**: Test and validate after each increment
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate testing results into next iteration
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure each increment meets quality standards

## üíª Code Quality & Architecture

### SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Derived classes can replace base classes
- **I**nterface Segregation: Specific interfaces over general ones
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Code Standards
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate duplicate code through abstraction
- **KISS Principle**: Keep implementations simple and readable
- **Modular Design**: Create loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging

### Code Organization
```

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Functions have single responsibilities
- [ ] No duplicate code patterns
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases and happy paths
- [ ] Code is properly formatted and linted
- [ ] Documentation explains complex logic
- [ ] Dependencies are minimal and necessary

## üêõ Debugging & Root Cause Analysis

### Structured Debugging Protocol
Use this table format for systematic debugging:

| Fact | Source | Hypothesis | Root Cause | Solution |
|------|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| What happened? | Where observed? | Why might it happen? | What's the actual cause? | How to fix it? |

### Debugging Process
1. **Fact Gathering**: Collect all relevant information about the issue
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring behaviors or symptoms
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Create testable explanations for the problem
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Use debugging tools and logs to verify the cause
5. **Solution Implementation**: Apply the most effective fix
6. **Verification**: Test that the fix resolves the issue without side effects

### Common Debugging Tools
- **Browser DevTools**: Network, console, and performance tabs
- **React DevTools**: Component state and props inspection
- **Logging**: Structured logging at appropriate levels
- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and log React component errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identify bottlenecks and slow operations

## üì¶ Git & Collaboration Workflow

### Commit Message Standards
```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
