Our platform highlights regulatory data and provides an AI Trust Score to help you assess broker safety."

It then compares your profile against our database of broker attributes—like costs, platforms, and regulation—to find the closest matches. It's a data-driven process designed to personalize your search."

Generally, ECN/STP brokers like Pepperstone or IC Markets offer very low raw spreads but charge a commission."
