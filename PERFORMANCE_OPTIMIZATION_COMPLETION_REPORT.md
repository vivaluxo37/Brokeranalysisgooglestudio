# Performance Optimization Completion Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive performance optimization implemented for the Broker Analysis Platform. The optimization focused on reducing initial bundle size, improving runtime performance, and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Optimization Summary

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives Achieved
