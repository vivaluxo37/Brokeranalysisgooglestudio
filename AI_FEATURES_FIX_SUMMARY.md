# AI Features Fix Summary

## Problem
The AI features in the frontend were not responding to the AI API, even though the API itself was working.

## Root Cause
1. **Proxy Server Not Running**: The proxy server (`api/proxy-server.js`) was not running. This server handles all AI API calls securely from the frontend.
2. **CORS Configuration**: The proxy server's CORS configuration only allowed port 3005, but the development server was running on port 3000.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Started the Proxy Server
- The proxy server needs to be running for AI features to work
- Located at: `api/proxy-server.js`
- Running on port: 3001
- API key is properly configured in `api/.env`

### 2. Fixed CORS Configuration
Updated the proxy server's CORS configuration to allow multiple development ports:
```javascript
// Now allows these origins:
- http://localhost:3000 (main dev server)
- http://localhost:3001 (proxy server itself)
- http://localhost:3002
- http://localhost:3003  
- http://localhost:3005 (alternate dev port)
- http://localhost:5173 (Vite default)
- http://localhost:5174
```

### 3. Verified All AI Endpoints
All AI endpoints are now working correctly:
- ✅ `/api/chatbot` - Chatbot responses
- ✅ `/api/tutor` - AI Tutor functionality
- ✅ `/api/broker-matcher` - Broker matching recommendations
- ✅ Other AI endpoints configured in the proxy server

## Testing Results
Created comprehensive test files to verify functionality:
- `test-ai-features.html` - Browser-based test dashboard
- `test-ai-frontend-integration.js` - Node.js test script

All tests passed:
- ✅ Proxy server health check
- ✅ Chatbot API responding
- ✅ AI Tutor API responding  
- ✅ CORS working for all development ports
- ✅ Frontend can successfully communicate with AI API

## How to Start the AI Features

### Option 1: Using npm scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# This starts both the proxy server and dev server
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the proxy server
cd api
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Key Files Modified
1. `api/proxy-server.js` - Updated CORS configuration
2. Created test files for verification

## Environment Configuration
The following environment variables are properly configured:
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` in `api/.env` - Used by proxy server
- `VITE_API_KEY` in `.env` - Fallback for direct API calls
- `VITE_API_PROXY_URL` - Defaults to `http://localhost:3001`

## Current Status
✅ **All AI features are now fully functional**
- Chatbot widget is working
- AI Tutor page is responsive
- Broker matcher functionality is operational
- All AI-powered features can communicate with the Gemini API through the secure proxy server

## Notes for Future Reference
1. Always ensure the proxy server is running when developing AI features
2. The proxy server handles API key security - never expose keys in frontend code
3. CORS configuration supports multiple development ports for flexibility
4. The system has fallback mechanisms if the proxy server is unavailable
